### [How to Structure a dbt Project, by Gwen Windflower](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview)

**Staging: Files and Folders**
- âœ… Subdirectories based on the source system (allows us to operate on those similar sets easily.)
        - *"Our internal transactional database is one system, the data we get from Stripe's API is another, and lastly the events from our Snowplow instrumentation. We've found this to be the best grouping for most companies, as source systems tend to share similar loading methods and properties between tables, and this allows us to operate on those similar sets easily."*
